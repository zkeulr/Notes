\section{Multiplexing}

\emph{Multiplexing} is when you rotate through a task fast enough
that it gives the appearance of being simultaneous.
Key scanning is a specific example of input multiplexing and encoding.
Another example is driving displays. Turn on one SSD at a time.
Rotate through them rapidly enough that your persistence
of vision makes it appear they are all on simultaneously and displaying
different digits.
