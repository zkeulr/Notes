\section{Sampling}

Under certain conditions,
a CT signal can be completely
represented by and recovered from
a set of sampled values. This fact
shocked me when I first heard it.
In general, if you consider
$n$ points, you would expect that
infinitely many possible CT signals
could pass through the given points,
as in Figure \ref{fig:sampling_ambiguity}.

The conditions under which a set of
samples uniquely determine a CT signal
is if its Fourier transform is zero
outside a finite band of frequencies,
and if the samples are taken sufficiently
close together in relation to the highest
frequency present in the signal. The result
is known as the \emph{sampling theorem}, and
it is both surprising and extremely useful.

\subsection{Sampling Theorem}
Let $x(t)$ be a band-limited signal with
$X(j\omega) = 0$ for $|\omega| > \omega_M$.
Then $x(t)$ is uniquely determined by its samples
$x(nT)$, $n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots$ if
\begin{equation}
    \omega_s > 2 \omega_M,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T}.
\end{equation}
Given these samples, we can reconstruct
$x(t)$ by generating a periodic impulse
train in which succesive impulses have amplitudes that are
successive sample values. This impulse train is
then processed through an ideal lowpass filter
with gain $T$ and cutoff frequency greater than $\omega_M$ and
less than $\omega_s - \omega_M$.
The resulting output signal will exactly equal $x(t)$.
