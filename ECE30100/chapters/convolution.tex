\section{Convolution}

Recall the sifting property of the discrete unit impulse,
\begin{equation}
    x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] \delta[n - k].
\end{equation}

This property is useful in that it allows us to represent
$x[n]$ as a series of scaled very simple functions. For a
linear system, the response will
