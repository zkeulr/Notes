\section{System Properties}

\subsection{Memoryless}
A \emph{mempryless} system output is dependent
only on the input at time $t$, and not previous states.

\subsection{Invertable}
A system is \emph{invertable} is distinct
inputs lead to distinct outputs. A system is not
invertable if there exists any $x(t) \neq x_2(t)$ such
that $y_1(t) = y_2(t)$.

\subsection{Linear}
