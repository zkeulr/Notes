\section{Templates}

A \emph{template} is useful for when you don't want
to prescribe a specific data type for some class.

For example, a template to create a pair
of any data types can be defined as
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,caption=-> Operator]
template <class T1, class T2> 
// can use 'typename' instead, like <typename T1 ...
class MyPair{
        private:
        T1 a;
        T2 b;
        public:
        T1 first ();
        T2 second ();
        MyPair( const T1 &mfirst,
        const T2 &msecond);
    };

// Instantiated as 
MyPair(1, "hello");
\end{lstlisting}

The convention followed in this class is that template definitions
go into \texttt{.h} files while the implementations go into \texttt{.hpp}
files, which must include the \texttt{.h} files.
