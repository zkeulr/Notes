\subsection{User Datagram Protocol}
One of the most popular transport layer implementations is
\emph{User Datagram Protocol}, UDP. UDP is unreliable,
connectionless, datagram-abstracted transport. Unreliable
in the sense of lacking an ACK, retransmission mechanism,
and window sizing. Datagram-abstracted in the sense of
using packets. Connectionless in the sense of sending
data without any explicit connection with the receiver.

A UDP header includes the following fields, each 16 bits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Source port.
    \item Destination port.
    \item Length, total size of UDP header + payload. Max size is $2^{16} - 1$ - IP header size bytes.
    \item Checksum, used for error detection. Set to 0s if unused.
\end{itemize}
