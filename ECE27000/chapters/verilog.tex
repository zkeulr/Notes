\section{Verilog}

SystemVerilog is a hardware description and verification language 
(HDVL) that extends Verilog by adding high-level programming constructs. 
It is widely used for modeling, simulating, and verifying digital 
systems.

The listing below is an example of a NAND gate expressed in SystemVerilog.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={NAND}, label={lst:nand_gate}]
module nand_gate (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    output logic y
);
    assign y = ~(a & b);
endmodule
\end{lstlisting}

In SystemVerilog, numbers are written in format
\texttt{[size]'[base][number]}, for example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4'b1001 (binary, 9 in decimal, bit width 4 bits)
    \item 8'hf1 (hex, equals 421, bit width 8 bits)
    \item 3'o3 (octal, 3, bit width 3 bits)
    \item 32'b1001\_1101\_0101\_1111 (binary, 40255, bit width 32 bits)
\end{itemize}
