\section{Introduction}

This class will be focused on \emph{interactive} computer graphics over
non-interactive graphics. In this class we will implement an interactive
computer graphics engine in a basic programming language like C. A good
understanding of professional and debugging and unit testing is required.

Let's look at a basic example of a GUI with some fundamental
components.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption=GUI, label=lst:gui]
    #pragma once 
    #include gui.h
    #include frambuffer.h

    class Scene {
        GUI *gui;
        FrameBuffer *fb;
        Scene();
        void DBG();
        void NewButton(); // when this is clicked, 
        // there is a callback to the 
        // code that made the scene
    }

    extern Scene *scene;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Frame Buffer}

% insert FrameBuffer code from course website here
The frame buffer stores the data that is going to be displayed
on the screen. In the case of Listing \ref{lst:gui} is a 1d array of unsigned integers.

\subsection{Callback}

% insert DBG code

\subsection{Scene}

\subsection{Drawing}

\subsection{Animation}
