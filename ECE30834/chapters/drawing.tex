\section{Drawing}

Drawing more complex shapes just requires connecting
vectors together and displaying them on screen. We can
translate them, rotate vectors, and shift the camera.

\subsection{Triangles}

In computer graphics, everything is made of triangles.
A \emph{shared-vertex triangle mesh} is a bunch of triangles
who can have the same vertices that forms some shape. A
triangle is fully specified with a triple of unsigned ints
that specify which indices in the array of vertices belong
to that triangle. For instance, with a cube made of 8 vectors,
each triangle needs only specify which three of the vectors
that form the vertices it has.

We now have every element needed to render 3d graphics.
With an array of vertices we can create a triangle mesh
and use a camera to project it onto the display plane.
There is still much to do, e.g. movement, shading, coloring,
but this wireframe is the basis of the rest of our work in
the course.
