\section{Drawing}

Drawing more complex shapes just requires connecting
vectors together and displaying them on screen. We can
translate them, rotate vectors, and shift the camera.

\subsection{Triangles}

In computer graphics, everything is made of triangles.
A \emph{shared-vertex triangle mesh} is a bunch of triangles
who can have the same vertices that forms some shape. A
triangle is fully specified with a triple of unsigned ints
that specify which indices in the array of vertices belong
to that triangle. For instance, with a cube made of 8 vectors,
each triangle needs only specify which three of the vectors
that form the vertices it has.

Once we have the ability to draw triangles, it would be
useful to be able to draw points and wire frames.
