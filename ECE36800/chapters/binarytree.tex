\section{Binary Tree}

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node
has at most two children. If each node has either two (in the
case of an internal node) or zero (in the case of a leaf node),
it is known as a \emph{strictly binary tree}.

\subsection{Binary Search Tree}

A binary search tree has the key of each internal node
being greater than all the keys in the respective node's
left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.
