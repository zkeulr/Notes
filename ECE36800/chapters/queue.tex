\section{Queue}
A queue is first in, first out. Entries are "enqueued" to insert 
them into the queue and "dequeued" to take them off the queue. 
Like a stack, queues can be implemented using linked lists. 

\section{Priority Queue}
Each element in a priority queue has an 
associated priority. In a priority queue, 
elements with high priority are served before 
elements with low priority. An example of this 
is airplane loading.
